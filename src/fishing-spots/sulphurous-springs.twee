**Sulphurous Springs**
Dwarven industry produces a lot of poisonous gasses, corrosive fluids and heavy metals, and not a single dwarf cares one whit. These sulphurous springs are the result of centuries of this industrial might seeping into the water table; a series of writhing pools bubbling with chemicals and poisonous metals. Still, nature always finds a way, and there's still fish to be caught from these strange waters.
