**Murky Hole**
Despite the less-than-inspiring name, Murky Hole isn't a terrible place to fish, not really. It's a mid-depth lake near Crowliver, situated in a boggy area of outstanding natural mediocrity. No-one would say the fish here are the most attractive specimens, or the most tasty, but they're plentiful and easy to catch.
