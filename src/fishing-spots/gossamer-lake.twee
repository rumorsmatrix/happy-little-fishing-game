**Gossamer Lake**
A gorgeous lake in one of the many parks of Moonfall Bay. The water is perfectly clear and tiny motes of crystalised light rise and shimmer from the surface. The locals, however, are not impressed to see you set out your equipment at the bank, and stare at you with strange, deep-black eyes.
