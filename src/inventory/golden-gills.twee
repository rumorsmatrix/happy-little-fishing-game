:: golden Gills {"position":"325,1200","size":"100,100"}
The golden Gill is the de-facto currency of the land. The fact that it's named after part of a fish is purely coincidental.

It's a small golden coin, roughly 1" in diameter. One side depicts an angry-looking sturgeon. The design on the reverse varies by the issuing kingdom, and usually depicts the ruling monarch, a long-dead politician, or soon-to-be-dead despot.
